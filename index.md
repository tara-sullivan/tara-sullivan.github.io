I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at University of California, San Diego.
You can see the most recent version of my CV [here](https://github.com/tara-sullivan/resume/blob/master/sullivan_resume.pdf).
If you'd like to get in contact, please email me at tasulliv [at] UCSD [dot] edu. 

My job market paper, "Group-based beliefs and human capital specialization," theoretically formalizes the following dynamic: if men and women have different beliefs about their respective probabilities of success in different fields, then men and women may respond to information shocks about their abilities in different ways; in a model of gradual specialization decisions, this results in gender gaps in college major choice. In this way, my model structurally links gender differences in beliefs based on current outcomes for women to gender gaps in certain fields of study. This presents a potential theoretical explanation for why there are persistently low levels of female participation in fields like Economics or Computer Science.
This project is ongoing, but you can see my work so far [here](https://github.com/tara-sullivan/hcs)
